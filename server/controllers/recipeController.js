// Pull off the chicken skin, lay it flat in a large, cold frying pan, place on a low heat and leave for a few minutes to render the fat, turning occasionally. Once golden, remove the crispy skin to a plate, adding a pinch of sea salt and five-spice.
// Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 3cm chunks and place in a bowl with 1 heaped teaspoon of five-spice, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of cornflour and half the lime juice. Peel, finely chop and add 1 clove of garlic, then toss to coat.
// Next, prep the veg: trim and roughly slice the asparagus and broccoli at an angle, leaving the pretty tips intact. Peel the onion, cut into quarters and break apart into petals, then peel the remaining clove of garlic and finely slice with the chillies. Deseed and roughly chop the peppers, then peel and matchstick the ginger.
// Place the frying pan on a high heat and cook the chicken for 5 to 6 minutes, or until golden and cooked through, turning halfway, then leave on a low heat.
// Meanwhile, place a wok on a high heat and scatter in the pepper and onion to scald and char for 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, followed by the peaches, pineapple, ginger, garlic, most of the chillies, the baby sweetcorn, asparagus and broccoli.
// Stir-fry for 3 minutes, then pour in the sauce. Cook for just a few minutes – you want to keep the veg on the edge of raw – adding a good splash of boiling water to loosen the sauce, if needed.
// Drizzle the honey into the chicken pan, turn the heat back up to high, and toss until sticky and caramelized. Plate up the veg and top with the chicken. Clank up the reserved crispy skin, and scatter over with the remaining chilli.
// Pick over the coriander leaves and serve right away, with lime wedges for squeezing over. Good with classic fluffy rice.

// When they’re ready, drain the mushrooms, then chop them and stir into the filling. Season to taste.
// In a small bowl, blend the cornflour and 2 tablespoons of cold water.
// Next, lay one spring-roll wrapper, smooth-side down, on a clean surface as a diamond shape, with one corner pointing down towards you. Sprinkle a little of the five spice powder over it, then place another wrapper on top (the extra thickness will stop the rolls from breaking open while cooking).
// Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling on the bottom corner of the double wrapper. Brush each corner with the cornflour mixture, then start rolling up from the bottom. When the filling is covered, pull the corners in from each side (to seal the ends as you go). Continue rolling until the filling is tightly covered, then press to seal the top corner.
// Lay the finished roll on a large baking tray and cover with a damp tea towel. Continue until you’ve filled all the wrappers.
// Heat the groundnut oil in a large wok or saucepan over a medium heat. To check whether the oil is ready, drop in a piece of potato; it should sizzle and start to turn golden. In small batches, carefully lower the spring rolls into the oil and deep-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
